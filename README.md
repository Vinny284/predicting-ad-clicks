# Predicting Ad Clicks

##Goals

The goal of this project is to build a model which predicts if a user has clicked on an advertisment based on the websites they have visted and to gain insight into which types of websites adverts should be placed on.
The file data2.csv contains a sample of 10,000 rows of user activity, showing the number of ad views per site per user. Also joined to this data, is whether or not the user clicked on the ad, shown as 1 for a click and 0 otherwise.
This is a modified file where the websites are grouped by type and the values are edited as I cannot upload the original dataset.
